# 'Transpire' Web Application 
## Created for QWERHacks 2021 

#### This is a protoype of a web application created for trans people to record and track information about their health and any medical transitioning options they are pursuing. Since most of the information on HRT/surgeries is "crowdsourced," anecdotal, etc. and many trans people don't have access to decent medical resources, Transpire also aims to anonymously gather this data to make it easy to access and compare to one's own journey.
